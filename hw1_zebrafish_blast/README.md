# HW1: BLAST and DIAMOND 
## Methods
Protein sequences from *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) were downloaded and formatted into a BLAST protein database using `makeblastdb`. Query peptide sequences (`mgProteome.fasta`) were searched against this database using `blastp` with an E-value threshold of 1e-5 and tabular output format. The same query sequences were then searched against a DIAMOND-formatted database using DIAMOND in `blastp` mode to compare search performance and results between the two programs.
## Results and Interpretation
BLASTP analysis identified multiple significant hits for many query peptides, indicating widespread sequence similarity between the query set and the zebrafish proteome. Several queries produced a large number of matches; for example, `MG_109` returned over 500 BLAST hits. Examination of alignment lengths for `MG_109` showed that most alignments were consistently approximately 140–150 amino acids in length, suggesting that this query corresponds to a conserved protein domain present across many zebrafish proteins rather than short low-complexity regions.
DIAMOND searches recovered comparable top hits for the same query peptides and produced a similar overall pattern of alignments, with 117 query sequences returning significant matches and a total of 677 pairwise alignments reported. While the biological results were highly consistent between BLAST and DIAMOND, DIAMOND completed the searches substantially faster, demonstrating its effectiveness as a high-performance alternative for large-scale protein similarity searches.
